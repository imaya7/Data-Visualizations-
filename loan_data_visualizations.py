# The three visualizations provide a good insight into the Loan Dataset. The bar plot shows the distribution of the loan intents
# across all the different types of loan categories. From this, we can conclude that the most common loan intent is for education, 
#  while the least common loan intent is for home improvements. 
# This could suggest that education is a priority for most individuals so it is necessary to take loans out for it. 
# The box plot shows the distribution of interest rates across all the different loan grades. 
# From this we can conclude that the interest rates are a lot higher for those with lower grades such as 
#  grade D and E. This helps us visualize the loan grades and the risk that people might face due to there 
#credit score. The worse someone's score is the higher the interest rate they will have to pay. 
# The stacked bar plot shows the default status of loans across all the different home ownership categories.
# No Default means that the loan was paid back while default means that the loan was not paid back. From this, we can 
#conclude that that individuals with a mortgage and who own their own homes tend to have more defaults than those who are renting.
#This could be because those who are renting may have less financial stress as they have roommates to help pay the rent, while 
#those with a home may have a more challenging time as they have to handle all the bills independently.
